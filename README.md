## Video for modeling demonstration in the 3D Modeling Client
This is a video that shows how ARWFML can be modeled in the new 3D Modeling Client:
- ["Video" -> 3D Modeling Client](./Color%20Brick%20Modeling%20Demonstration.mp4)

(You have to download the .mp4 since it is too big for github.)


## Video of the AR Engine
This is a video that shows how the created ARWFML models can be executed in the AR Engine. The video shows the color brick use case, but with longer time triggers than in the example model in the paper:
- ["Video" -> AR Engine](./AR%20Engine%20Color%20Brick%20Demonstration%20long%20conditions.mp4)

(You have to download the .mp4 since it is too big for github.)
